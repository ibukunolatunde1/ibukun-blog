Hi there! My name is Ibukun and I am a DevOps engineer with a strong focus on cloud native solutions. I have a passion for automating infrastructure and am skilled in using tools such as Terraform and Kubernetes to deploy and manage cloud environments on platforms like Azure and AWS. I've worked with all kinds of cloud platforms, including Azure and AWS, and know my way around a Linux terminal like a pro.

I have experience working on a variety of projects, including building CI/CD pipelines, implementing cloud cost optimization strategies, and improving the reliability and scalability of applications. I am proficient with Linux systems and have experience with observability and monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.

I am a strong collaborator and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to drive successful project outcomes. I am dedicated to continuous learning and am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills.

Fast-forward to today I am a cloud consultant in the various sectors, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at [ipNX](https://ipnxnigeria.net), [Tek Experts](https://tek-experts.com), [Deimos](https://deimos.io), [GoMoney](https://gomoney.global) and [Interswitch](https://interswitchgroup.com)
