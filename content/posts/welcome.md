Yikes!!!, so I have decided to create my blog. I'd rather say gotten the courage, time and dedication (ðŸ™ˆðŸ‘€) because I've always wanted to add my own blog to the billions of blogs out there.

But I think this is gonna be different from all the many blogs you've seen, because firstly this blog is just an extension of my memory. I've been priviledged to work on many projects in many teams, and have done some pretty cool stuff.

I want to kinda keep a mental note of it - like a hocrux - and I hope that it makes some sense to you, and you see something that you've either done, or learning to do, or shouldn't even do.

Yet another devops blog, might also do other stuff asides devops, like personal writing but I'll try to stick with work stuff (ðŸ˜‰). I hope to make it interesting, and I hope you enjoy it. See you soon !
