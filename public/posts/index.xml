      <description>Yikes!!!, so I have decided to create my blog. I&amp;rsquo;d rather say gotten the courage, time and dedication (ðŸ™ˆðŸ‘€) because I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to add my own blog to the billions of blogs out there.
But I think this is gonna be different from all the many blogs you&amp;rsquo;ve seen, because firstly this blog is just an extension of my memory. I&amp;rsquo;ve been priviledged to work on many projects in many teams, and have done some pretty cool stuff.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Yikes!!!, so I have decided to create my blog. I&amp;rsquo;d rather say gotten the courage, time and dedication (ðŸ™ˆðŸ‘€) because I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to add my own blog to the billions of blogs out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think this is gonna be different from all the many blogs you&amp;rsquo;ve seen, because firstly this blog is just an extension of my memory. I&amp;rsquo;ve been priviledged to work on many projects in many teams, and have done some pretty cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to kinda keep a mental note of it - like a hocrux - and I hope that it makes some sense to you, and you see something that you&amp;rsquo;ve either done, or learning to do, or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another devops blog, might also do other stuff asides devops, like personal writing but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to stick with work stuff (ðŸ˜‰). I hope to make it interesting, and I hope you enjoy it. See you soon !&lt;/p&gt;
