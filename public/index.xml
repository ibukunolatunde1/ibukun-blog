      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! My name is Ibukun and I am a DevOps engineer with a strong focus on cloud native solutions. I have a passion for automating infrastructure and am skilled in using tools such as Terraform and Kubernetes to deploy and manage cloud environments on platforms like Azure and AWS. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with all kinds of cloud platforms, including Azure and AWS, and know my way around a Linux terminal like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experience working on a variety of projects, including building CI/CD pipelines, implementing cloud cost optimization strategies, and improving the reliability and scalability of applications. I am proficient with Linux systems and have experience with observability and monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a strong collaborator and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to drive successful project outcomes. I am dedicated to continuous learning and am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to today I am a cloud consultant in the various sectors, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipnxnigeria.net&#34;&gt;ipNX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tek-experts.com&#34;&gt;Tek Experts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://deimos.io&#34;&gt;Deimos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gomoney.global&#34;&gt;GoMoney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://interswitchgroup.com&#34;&gt;Interswitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Yikes!!!, so I have decided to create my blog. I&amp;rsquo;d rather say gotten the courage, time and dedication (ðŸ™ˆðŸ‘€) because I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to add my own blog to the billions of blogs out there.
But I think this is gonna be different from all the many blogs you&amp;rsquo;ve seen, because firstly this blog is just an extension of my memory. I&amp;rsquo;ve been priviledged to work on many projects in many teams, and have done some pretty cool stuff.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I want to kinda keep a mental note of it - like a hocrux - and I hope that it makes some sense to you, and you see something that you&amp;rsquo;ve either done, or learning to do, or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another devops blog, might also do other stuff asides devops, like personal writing but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to stick with work stuff (ðŸ˜‰). I hope to make it interesting, and I hope you enjoy it. See you soon !&lt;/p&gt;
